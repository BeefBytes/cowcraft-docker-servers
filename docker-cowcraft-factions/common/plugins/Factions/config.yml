# Debug
# Turn this on if you are having issues with something and working on resolving them.
# This will spam your console with information that is useful if you know how to read the source.
# It's suggested that you only turn this on at the direction of a developer.
debug: false

# Prevent find factions exploit
# This will help limit how many times a player can be sent a map of factions.
# Set this to the cooldown you want, in miliseconds, for a map to be shown to a player.
# If you want to log when a player violates this (only happens on chunk enter so it shouldn't be too spammy),
#   set log to true and it will be logged to console as "player tried to show a faction map too soon and triggered exploit blocker."
findfactionsexploit:
  cooldown: 2000 # in miliseconds. 2000 = 2 seconds.
  log: false

### Hard Core Settings ###
# Many of the features that are / are to come in this section have been requested by
#   people in relation to HCF servers. All settings are set to the normal Factions
#   behavior by default.

# Default Relation allows you to change the default relation for Factions.
# Example usage would be so people can't leave then make a new Faction while Raiding
#   in order to be able to execute commands if the default relation is neutral.
# This has always been neutral.
default-relation: "neutral"

# Portal Creation
# Do you want to limit portal creation?
portals:
  limit: false # will disable the below check if set to false

  # What should the minimum relation be to create a portal in territory?
  # Goes in the order of: ENEMY, NEUTRAL, ALLY, MEMBER.
  # Minimum relation allows that and all listed to the right to create portals.
  # Example: put ALLY to allow ALLY and MEMBER to be able to create portals.
  minimum-relation: MEMBER # If typed incorrectly, defaults to NEUTRAL.

### Hard Core Settings ###

# Warps
# What should be the max amount of warps that a Factoin can set?
max-warps: 3

# This is the cost section for warps.
# It will charge them each time the command would be successful. (won't charge on erroneous /f warp attempts).
# You can use decimal places here.
# If enabled is set to false, it will ignore the values.
warp-cost:
  enabled: false
  setwarp: 5
  delwarp: 5
  warp: 5

# Pistons
# Should we disable pistons in Faction territory? This will prevent people from doing something like:
# http://i.gyazo.com/6a1a31222e58a5d60ff341c13f6a8404.gif
disable-pistons-in-territory: false

# ToolTips
# This section is to configure tooltips for things like /f list
tooltips:

  # List
  # This shows up when someone does /f list for the top factions.
  # It will not sure up for factionless of course, just actual factions.
  # You can use color codes here.

    - "&7Members: &b{online}/{members}"

  # Show
  # This shows up when someone does /f show.
  # It adds tooltips to each player in the list here, nothing else.
  # {group} will show the players primary group if you have vault installed.
  # {balance} will show their balance if you have vault installed.
  # {lastSeen} will show human readable info on when the player was last seen, or online.

    - "&7Power &b{power}"
    - "&7Balance &b${balance}"

# Configuration section for Scoreboards
# This will allow you to completely customize how your scoreboards look.
# Make sure that no lines are duplicates of each other otherwise only the first will display.
# Use &0-9a-f for colors and include messages in "quotes"

  expiration: 7

# FInfo scoreboard is displayed when a player walks into a new Faction's territory.
# Scoreboard disappears after <expiration> seconds.
# Things to be replaced in this:
# {power} - faction's power. {chunks} - total claimed chunks. {members} - total members.
# {online} - online members. {leader} - faction's leader. {open} - shows either true or false if open.
# {raidable} - true if the faction can be claimed over, otherwise false.
# {warps} - the number of warps that a faction has set.
# The title of the scoreboard will be the Faction's tag and colored according to the relation with the player's Faction.
# Commenting this section out will cause the info to appear in chat as the plugin originally did.

# Default board that will always show up if a player wants it to.
# This can show any arbitrary text or you can use a lot of variables to replace things.
# Replace {name} - player's name. {faction} - player's faction title, factionless if none.
# {totalOnline} - total players on the server. {balance} - player's balance.
# {maxPower} - player's max power.

  #   The scoreboard needs to be enabled for this to work.

#################### HCF Features ####################
######################################################
# These features were requested as part of Hardcore Factions or something.
# All of them are disabled by default.

# Max Relation Types
# Limits factions to having a max number of each relation.
# Setting to 0 means none allowed. -1 for disabled.
# This will have no effect on default or existing relations, only when relations are changed.
# It is advised that you set the default relation to -1 so they can always go back to that.
# Otherwise Factions could be stuck with not being able to unenemy other Factions.
max-relations:
  enabled: true
  ally: 3
  truce: -1
  neutral: -1
  enemy: -1

# WorldBorder support 
# A buffer of 0 means faction claims can go right up to the border of the world.
# The buffer is in chunks, so 1 as a buffer means an entire chunk of buffer between 
# the border of the world and what can be claimed to factions
world-border:
  buffer: 0
  
# Raids
# Allow a faction to be raided if they have more land than power.
# This will make claimed territory lose all protections
#   allowing factions to open chests, break blocks, etc. if they
#   have claimed chunks >= power.
hcf:
  raidable: false

  # DTR (death til raidable) will be in /f show if enabled. Configure the message in the lang.yml
  dtr: false

  # Should we allow Factions to over claim if they are raidable (above has no effect on this)?
  # This has always been true, allowing factions to over claim others.
  allow-overclaim: true

  # Power Freeze
  # After a player dies, how long should the faction not be able to regen power?
  # This resets on each death but does not accumulate.
  # Set to 0 for no freeze. Time is in seconds.
  powerfreeze: 0

  # Buffer Zone
  # Buffer Zone is an chunk area required between claims of different Factions.
  # This is default to 0 and has always been that way. Meaning Factions can have
  #   claims that border each other.
  # If this is set to 3, then Factions need to have 3 chunks between their claim
  #   and another Faction's claim.
  # It's recommended to keep this pretty low as the radius check could be a
  #   heavy operation if set to a large number.
  # If this is set to 0, we won't even bother checking which is how Factions has
  #   always been.
  buffer-zone: 0

  stuck:
    delay: 30
    radius: 10
